    <p>“Be the change you wanna see in the world ” - Gandhi <br>
        <br>
        My name is Sania SAEL. I was born on February 26, 2003 in a town called Port-Salut, located in the southern part of Haiti. 
        I am the eldest of a family of two children.<br> My father is an economist by profession, my mother is a dress maker. My parents 
        raised me with love and honesty.<br> They taught me to love the people around me and to treat them the way I would love to be 
        treated. My father particularly taught me to give my best in everything I undertake; he taught me to never settle for less than 
        what I deserve and to always keep in mind that the impossible could become possible if I really believe in it and put in the 
        effort. <br>I remember he often told me that there is no greater pride than to taste the fruits of one’s hard work. Those words
        have been a guidance for me throughout my entire life. They helped me overcome obstacles and keep working on my goals, even when 
        the most unfortunate circumstances took me by storm.  
       <br>Studious, visionary and full of ambition, I am one those who believe that success is in the effort and that one must always 
        aim for excellence, no matter how far you have come from. That is why, at school I always worked hard and did my best to be 
        among the best students of my class. Throughout my years in high school, I took part in many extracurricular activities, 
        including debates, speech competitions, and so on, which allowed me to open up to the world and develop my communication skills. 
        I am passionate about reading, music and painting. I remember spending all my free time in high school singing, drawing and
        writing. This passion for music and book took me to write my first book at the age of 15 and to participate in many text 
        competitions. My academic performances enabled me to integrate a non-profit organization that rewards students with a excellent 
        academic records. With them, I had the opportunity to carry out numerous voluntary works that consisted of visiting orphanages, 
        helping the people that are in need and try put a smile on their lips, by making them feel they are important.  
      <br> It is said that behind each person there is a story; there is a reason why we are what we are today. I was coming back from 
        school when, suddenly I stumbled upon a little boy caught stealing some snack from a merchant. All the people around were 
        furious to the point they did not event take pains to listen to what he had to say. He was  in tears, stammering, with his arms 
        on his face trying to hide his shame. No kid should have to face that, I instantly said to myself. I had to intervene to prevent 
        him from being physically punished. It turned out he was already seen begging in a near village and that he was an orphan. I was 
        standing there, like an automaton looking at him and imagining how many other kids may be going through the same sort of shameful circumstances. I had a click in my brain and I told myself that I could help change things too. After all, there is no reason to criticize something if we are not willing to do something about it.<br> Since that day, I made a promise to myself, that I would try my best contribute as much as I can to put a smile on the lips of those who are unhappy, to stand for those who are victims of injustice. 
       <br>My biggest dream is to become an influential woman, capable of validly representing my country and stand for the well-being 
        of the most deprived people. I dream of becoming a woman who, instead of taking advantage of her position to generate corruption
        will actively participate in the reconstruction of her country. An altruistic woman who will restore the taste of life to 
        orphans, to the most marginalized people in society. Last year, I received the Taiwan MOFA scholarship allowing me to carry out
        higher studies in Taiwan. Over the last few months, I have been learning Chinese at National  Central University and experiencing
        another culture. I have learned to see things from a global perspective. I have also realized how much the world needs people 
        that care for each other. Taiwan is a country known worldwide for its highly sophisticated infrastructures and seems to be the 
        ideal country to study civil engineering and then continue with my further goal of obtaining an advanced degree in the field of 
        transport and environment. There will be stumbling blocks, but I am willing to dedicate myself body and soul to achieve my dreams.</p>
